# Python Basics

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## Key Features

Python supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming. It has a large standard library and a dynamic type system.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you can assign values to variables without declaring their type:
- Integers: `x = 10`
- Strings: `name = "Python"`
- Lists: `items = [1, 2, 3]`
- Dictionaries: `data = {"key": "value"}`

## Control Flow

Python uses indentation to define code blocks:
```python
if condition:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```

## Functions

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
